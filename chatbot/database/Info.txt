1) This folder is about mongodb database
2) Dockerfile will create the Mongodb database
2) test.js file will insert the dummy entry into of data into
   mongodb container in database chatbot. Also test.js is
   creating user name chatbot for chatbot database.
3) Reason to create test.js is because environment variable
   MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE=chatbot will only if there is some script
   inside docker-entrypoint-initdb.d (docker-entrypoint-initdb.d will run
   script inside itself into the mondo db container when mongodb container
   run)
